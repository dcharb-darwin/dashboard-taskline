# PRD-002: Project Execution Workflow

## Goal
Improve project execution once templates exist: bulk updates, workflow control, and reliability for day-to-day delivery.

## Scope
- Bulk edit tasks (owner, dates, status).
- Dependency validation and critical-path hints.
- Task workflow guardrails (status transitions).
- Planned vs actual budget tracking at project/task level.
- Unified filtering and saved views across List/Calendar/Gantt.

## Acceptance criteria
- PM can update many tasks in one action.
- Task dependency issues are visible before save.
- Team can save and re-open named filters.
- Budget summaries show planned vs actual in project detail.
